It is possible to do most things, including source-level debugging, profiling and hot reload when you debug Flutter apps for eLinux.

## 1. Getting the Observatory port
You will find the following message in the console when you run Flutter apps. You need to attach a debugger to this port when you want to debug it. **Note that the URI changes every time after launching**.

```Shell
flutter: Observatory listening on http://127.0.0.1:43377/390I4oPyQ0U=/
```
## 2. Flutter attach debugger

```Shell
$ cd <path_to_flutter_project>/
$ flutter-elinux attach --device-id=flutter-tester --debug-uri=http://127.0.0.1:43377/390I4oPyQ0U=/
